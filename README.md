<h1>Perl Code</h1>

Scripts that I've written throughout the years to support various systems... 

Mostly on Solaris at this point.


<h3>cleanup.pl</h3>

<p>This script was used to clean out data after a certain time period. It simply would delete data from
the table that was older than a specified date. This was mostly used in testing, but also was planned
for cleaning out historical data after some time where it was deemed no longer useful.</p>

<h3>gridreport.pl</h3>

<p>Management was interested in particular pieces of information, so this script was an attempt to make those
reports available on the web so the managers requesting the data could access it independently of waiting for
an SA to execute the report. It was quickly deprecated when the Solaris environment was no longer the platform
of choice, so no further reports than what exist now were ever added.</p>
